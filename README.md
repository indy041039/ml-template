# End-to-End Machine Learning Template
- Building my own end-to-end machine learning template for using my own project
- This project structure based on my experience and my previous projects
- Note taking
 - Focus on classification task first, split main components into 4 task (3 necessary task + 1 optional task)
    - Model (scikit-learn)
    - Preprocessor (scikit-learn)
    - Tuner (custom)
    - Evaluator (custom)
- the last 2 components is not necessary but I want to do it for fun lol
